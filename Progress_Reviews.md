# Progress Reviews

__Participation in progress reviews is mandatory.__


### Option 1: Activity monitoring demo
* 	Will take place in the virtual classroom (WebEx)
*   Consider an option of making a video of a running demo OR sharing your smartphone's sceen over WebEx.
*   You need to show: 1) your app is working smoothly, and 2) the performance is reasonably good. Evaluate activity recognition performance by showing classification accuracy on your test set (=confusion matrix).

### Options 2: Progress review

You wil be asked questions from the list below. Depending on your progress you may or may not know all the answers yet.
 
*    What is the goal of your app?
*    What is the state-of-the-art in the field? Survey methods that provide a solution to the same or similar problem. 
*    Which approach did you decide to use and why?
*    Are there data sets you can build on? If not, how do you efficiently gather / annotate / bootstrap your data?
*    If you already have the first version of a model, how well does it perform? Present a confusion matrix, model performance on test data, etc.
*    What is the status of your app implementation? Are you well on track?
*    What will you show in your final demo?
*    If you work in a team, how did you split your work?

__Hint__: Start adding answers to the above questions to your report.
