We will formulate 2 sentences to describe what your app does and add tags to your social media streams / repositories if you wish so. Olga will also add a short description of your app to the <a href=\"http://olgasaukh.com/mcl.html\">MCL page</a>. If you don’t want your work / your pictures be shared this way, please let Olga know. We will only do this if all team members give us their consent!\n",
