    "If you decided to go for Option 1, you should have a mobile app providing the following functionality:\n",
    "* Gathering sensor data (from accelerometer, gyroscope, etc.)\n",
    "* Extracting features from this data\n",
    "* Using kNN (or another method) to attribute the feature vector to the right activity. The model parameters are determined offline using your own data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your app should be fairly accurate when tested with a smartphone held and fixed in the same position on your body as when gathering training data. If you change the position (e.g., by rotating the phone or fixing it to your leg instead of your arm) your activitiy recognition may (and most probably will) fail because measured signal will look fairly different (see below). In this workshop you will learn how one can address the problem with __on-device transfer learning__. We will create a generic model and personalize it on the phone.\n",

    "## Transfer Learning for Model Personalization\n",
    "\n",
    "Transfer learning is inspired by the way human learners take advantage of their existing knowledge and skills: A human who knows how to read literature is more likely to succeed in reading scientific papers than a human who does not know how to read at all. In the context of supervised learning, transfer learning implies the ability to reuse the knowledge of the dependency structure between features and labels learned in one setting to improve the inference of the dependency structure in another setting.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose that you want to get the best user experience possible by adjusting the model to users’ needs (specific position or way of carrying a smartphone, etc.). Sending user data to the cloud to train a model requires a lot of care to prevent potential privacy breaches. It's not always practical to send data to a central server for training---issues like power, data caps, and privacy can be problematic. However, training directly on device is a strong approach with many benefits: Privacy-sensitive data stays on the device so it saves bandwidth, and it works without an Internet connection.\n",
    "\n",
    "Training can require a non-trivial number of data samples which is hard to get on-device. Training a deep network from scratch can take days on the cloud so it's not suitable on device. Instead of training a whole new model from scratch, we can retrain an already trained model to adapt to a similar problem through transfer learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Transfer learning involves using a pre-trained model for one “data-rich” task and retraining a part of its layers (typically the last ones) to solve another, “data-poor” task. This is usually done by re-training only the last few layers (the head) of a neural network. The remaining layers are frozen and not updated. This is how the knowledge learned by on a data-rich task is transfered. Below you can how the head of a neural network on the left is cut off and replaced by a new head to be trained, while the bottom part of the network remains unchanged.\n",
