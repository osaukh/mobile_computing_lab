    "\n",
    "__Machine learning__ has enabled us to build complex applications with great accuracy. Whether it has to do with images, videos, text or even audio, machine learning can solve problems from a wide range. Tensorflow can be used to realize all of these applications. __TensorFlow__ is an open source software library for machine learning, developed by Google and currently used in many of their projects. \n",
    "\n",
    "The reason for its popularity is the ease with which developers can build and deploy applications. The GitHub projects we will look at during this workshop are very powerful but also so easy to work with. Moreover, Tensorflow was created with __processing power limitations__ in mind. The library can be ran on computers of all kinds, even on smartphones.\n",

    "### Machine learning\n",
    "Machine learning allows computers to __learn__. Traditionally, we always got computers to do things by providing a strict set of instructions. Machine Learning uses a very different approach. Instead of giving the computer a set of instructions on how to do something, we give it instructions on how to learn to do something. For example: think of a system that can classify pictures of animals as ‘cat’, ‘dog’, or ‘mouse’. Instead of manually finding unique characteristics from images of those animals and then coding it up, machine learning takes in images of those animals and finds characteristics and differences by itself. This process of teaching the computer is referred to as training.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Deep learning\n",
    "Deep learning is a technique for implementing machine learning. It uses neural networks to learn, sometimes, using decision trees may also be referred to as deep learning, but for the most part deep learning involves the use of neural networks. You can imagine a neural network as a series of doors one after another and think of yourself as the ‘input’ to the neural network. Every time you open a door, you become a different person. By the time you open the last door, you have become a very different person. When you exit through the last door, you become the ‘output’ of the neural network. Each door, in this case, represents a layer. A neural network, therefore, is a collection of layers that transform the input in some way to produce an output.\n",

    "## 2. Installing TensorFlow\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python\n",
    "\n",
    "TensorFlow programs are written in Python, which you can download at https://www.python.org/downloads/\n",
    "\n",
    "### TensorFlow\n",
    "\n",
    "The next step is to <a href=\"https://www.tensorflow.org/install/\">Install TensorFlow</a>.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to test the installation, write this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> import tensorflow as tf\n",
    ">>> hello = tf.constant('Hello, Tensorflow')\n",
    ">>> sess = tf.Session()\n",
    ">>> print(sess.run(hello))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You should see a \"Hello, Tensorflow\" output now. Also see TensorFlow examples: <a href=\"https://github.com/aymericdamien/TensorFlow-Examples\">TensorFlow Examples</a>.\n",
    "\n",
    "TensorFlow is a programming paradigm that Google developed internally for Machine Learning.\n",
    "TensorFlow follows a Dataflow-like paradigm. TensorFlow programs get converted into a directed graph. This graph represents a dataflow computation with data flowing from nodes via the graph edges. Each node has multiple inputs and outputs and it represents a certain operation. Most of the data that flows in the graph is represented as Tensor. Tensors are typed arrays of arbitrary dimensions — a construct quite useful when your are dealing with Matrices or system of equations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. TensorFlow Lite\n",
    "\n",
    "TensorFlow Lite is a set of tools to help developers run TensorFlow models on mobile, embedded, and IoT devices. It enables on-device machine learning inference with low latency and a small binary size.\n",
    "\n",
    "TensorFlow Lite consists of two main components:\n",
    "* The __TensorFlow Lite interpreter__, which runs specially optimized models on many different hardware types, including mobile phones, embedded Linux devices, and microcontrollers.\n",
    "* The __TensorFlow Lite converter__, which converts TensorFlow models into an efficient form for use by the interpreter, and can introduce optimizations to improve binary size and performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://www.tensorflow.org/images/tflite-architecture.jpg\" width=\"600\">\n",
    "\n",
    "### Machine learning at the edge\n",
    "\n",
    "TensorFlow Lite is designed to make it easy to perform machine learning on devices, \"at the edge\" of the network, instead of sending data back and forth from a server. For developers, performing machine learning on-device can help improve:\n",
    "\n",
    "* _Latency_: there's no round-trip to a server\n",
    "* _Privacy_: no data needs to leave the device\n",
    "* _Connectivity_: an Internet connection isn't required\n",
    "* _Power consumption_: network connections are power hungry\n",
    "\n",
    "TensorFlow Lite works with a huge range of devices, from tiny microcontrollers to powerful mobile phones.\n",
