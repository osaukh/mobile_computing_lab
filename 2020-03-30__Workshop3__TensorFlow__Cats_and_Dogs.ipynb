    "\n",
    "In this tutorial you will build an app which classifies camera input steam to detect cats and dogs. We have 25,000 labeled pictures of dogs and cats. The data comes from Kaggle’s Dogs vs Cats challenge. That’s how a bunch of them look like:\n",

    "It takes 1min to train the model, but the performance is not very good. I used the model trained for around 5 hours on Google Compute Engine instance with 16 vCPUs (cost: ~3.5 euro). The model achieves accuracy of 98.2% and can distinguish 8 categories of animals: dog, tiger, bear, jaguars, cow, rhinoceros, elephant, cat.\n",
