# Final Demos and Report

__Participation in the final class is mandatory.__

### Demo Instructions


*   Thoroughly test your demos!
*   A small external committee will be grading your final demos. 
    -    Be prepared to describe your app and why it is cool (no slides required).    
    -    The committee members are generalists and have background knowledge in mobile computing. 
    -    The committee wants to see that your app works great and you know your algorithms well.
    -    The committee will ask you questions about your apps. Be prepared to give quantitative estimations of your app performance.

*   Your final grade is based on the following grading scheme:
	- 10 points -- Performance in the intermediate demo / progress review
    - 10 points -- Novelty, your ideas, attention to detail, code clarity
    - 60 points -- Working demo and performance results
    - 20 points -- Quality of the report (structure, readability, completeness) and final video

* Grading scheme:
    - &#8805; 90 --> 1 (excellent)
    - &#8805; 78 --> 2 (good)
    - &#8805; 65 --> 3 (satisfactory)
    - &#8805; 50 --> 4 (sufficient)
    - < 50 --> 5 (insufficient)

There will be presents for the best projects!

### Final Report Instructions

*   Please send your reports per email (saukh@tugraz.at)
*   Use paper-style <a href="https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html">IEEE format</a>, 10pt, two columns, submit as PDF.
*   Your report must contain the following information:
    -   App description (What does your app do?) and a motivation statement (Why did you decide to go for this idea?)
	-   State-of-the art in the field. Search for resent papers on the topic and write what they / you do differently (option 2).
    -   Algorithms and models, tricks and twists you used.
    -   Achieved performance / accuracy (please do test your app in different contexts and evaluate its performance thoroughly).
    -   Screenshots showing your app in action.
    -   A link to your GitHub / GitLab repository (make sure Olga can access it).
    -   Description of your app limitations (What can be improved? What app extensions are feasible?)
	- 	A download link to a video showing your app in action.

*   Once Olga has received your report, she will send you your final grade and a short justification.

### Concluding Remarks

* If you agree, we will share your final videos with a short message through the social media channels of our department to promote your work and the course. Olga will also add a short description of your app to the <a href="http://olgasaukh.com/mcl.html">MCL page</a>. If you donâ€™t want your work / your pictures to be shared this way, let Olga know. We will only do this if all team members give us their consent!

* Please evaluate the course in TUG online. You can also share any suggestions how to improve the course per email. Thank you! We take your feedback seriously.

* In winter semester Olga teaches two courses <a href="https://online.tugraz.at/tug_online/wbLv.wbShowLVDetail?pStpSpNr=257936">Fault-Tolerant Distributed Algorithms</a> (see a preliminary list of topics from the last year) and <a href="https://online.tugraz.at/tug_online/wbLv.wbShowLVDetail?pStpSpNr=259749">Embedded Machine Learning</a>. If interested, Olga is more than happy to see you in the class!
