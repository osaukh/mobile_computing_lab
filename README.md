# Mobile Computing Lab (448.066) @ TUGraz

The course provides an introduction to the current research trends in the area of smartphones. The course will be based on a programming project, where students will form groups of two to develop a smartphone app for Android. To program a smartphone app, a developer needs to be familiar with (1) the signals and data that smartphones can gather, and (2) the mathematical tools necessary to process this data. We will use state-of-the-art algorithms, signal processing, and machine learning techniques to develop exciting mobile applications.
