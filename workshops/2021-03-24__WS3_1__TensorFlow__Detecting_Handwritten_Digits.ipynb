    "This is a handwritten character image (MNIST) classifier that can run on any Android device. The app stores a model  set of images (0-9) that we can cycle through and classify in order. It uses a pre-trained model to perform inference on the device. This idea can be applied to any images, both by using the camera and by pulling from the Web. We're using preloaded images so we can run the app in a simulator (no need for the device since it doesn't require a camera).\n",

    "When solving with a CPU an Optimization Problem, you Iteratively apply an Algorithm over some Input Data. In each of these iterations you usually update a Metric of your problem doing some Calculations on the Data. Now when the size of your data is large it might need a considerable amount of time to complete every iteration, and may consume a lot of resources. So sometimes you choose to apply these iterative calculations on a Portion of the Data to save time and computational resources. This portion is the batch_size and the process is called (in the Neural Network Lingo) batch data processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the neural network terminology:\n",
    "* one __epoch__ = one forward pass and one backward pass of all the training examples\n",
    "* __batch size__ = the number of training examples in one forward/backward pass. The higher the batch size, the more memory space you'll need.\n",
    "* number of __iterations__ = number of passes, each pass using [batch size] number of examples. To be clear, one pass = one forward pass + one backward pass (we do not count the forward pass and backward pass as two different passes).\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages:\n",
    "* It requires less memory. Since you train network using less number of samples the overall training procedure requires less memory. It's especially important in case if you are not able to fit dataset in memory.\n",
    "* Typically networks trains faster with mini-batches. That's because we update weights after each propagation. In our example we've propagated 11 batches (10 of them had 100 samples and 1 had 50 samples) and after each of them we've updated network's parameters. If we used all samples during propagation we would make only 1 update for the network's parameter.\n",

    "\n",
    "We use the TensorFlow Lite converter to convert the model into an optimized one for mobile devices. TensorFlow Lite uses the optimized [FlatBuffers](https://google.github.io/flatbuffers/) format to represent graphs. FlatBuffers play an essential role in efficiently serializing model data and providing quick access to that data while maintaining a small binary size. This is particularly useful for model files that are heavily populated with numerical weight data that can, by virtue of their size, create a lot of latency in read operations. Using FlatBuffer protocols as the basis for this transformation, TensorFlow Lite can bypass a lot of the traditionally expensive file parsing and un-parsing that contributes to slower execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, a TensorFlow model needs to be converted into a FlatBuffer file before deploying it to Android. The TensorFlow Lite converter generates a TensorFlow Lite FlatBuffer file (.tflite) from a TensorFlow model."

    "The Interpreter Core is responsible for executing Lite models in client applications using a reduced set of TensorFlowâ€™s operators. By limiting the default operators, libraries, and tools required to run the Lite models, the Interpreter Core has been trimmed to a lean ~100kb alone or ~300kb with all supported kernels.\n",

    "\n",
    "TensorFlow Lite optimizations reach all the way down to the hardware. Working within the tight constraints of mobile and embedded devices means that processors must be utilized at a hyper-efficient standard. The Android NDK contains a Neural Network API (NNAPI) that provides access to hardware-accelerated inference operations on Android devices. The NNAPI interfaces with TensorFlow Lite to seek out paths for model operations to leverage advantageous hardware where available. With the expectation of machine learning hardware becoming more available on Edge devices, the advantages of the NNAPI framework will become more apparent.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2019, the TensorFlow team released support for a GPU backend that will allow for a subset of models and operations to selectively utilize GPUs on mobile devices. The update will benefit models with excess parallelizable work and those that suffer from quantization precision-loss, giving them increases in speed and efficiency (up to 7x for some neural nets). The TensorFlow team promises to increase the set of models and operators currently supported to provide more comprehensive coverage in the future.\n",

    "#### Quantization\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantization in TensorFlow Lite refers to the process of reducing operation precision from 32-bit floating point numbers to 8-bit values. Post-training quantization is encouraged in TensorFlow Lite and is provided as an attribute of the TensorFlow Lite Converter during the conversion step. Benchmarking has shown that compressed model inference latency can be reduced up to 3x while maintaining a negligible drop in inference accuracy.\n",
